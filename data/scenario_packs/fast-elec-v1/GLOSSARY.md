The Fast Electrification scenario modifies two assumptions from the
baseline pack:

1. **carbon_price** – the price per tonne of carbon emitted.  Raising this value
   encourages adoption of low–emission technologies.
2. **capex** – the capital expenditure per unit of capacity.  Lowering this
   accelerates the uptake of electricity technologies.
