This directory contains the baseline assumptions pack used by the toy
simulation.  It defines parameters such as capital and operating costs,
emissions intensities, demand, and investment decisions for a single
region (AUS) and two technologies (electricity and hydrogen).  The
pack is intentionally simplified to demonstrate the end‑to‑end
pipeline.
