# AgentZero: Overarching Goals and Themes

## 1. Purpose
AgentZero is conceived as a next‑generation decarbonisation pathways platform built around agent-based decision-making, full transparency, and trust-by-design principles. The objective is not merely to construct a model, but to produce a national capability: a reproducible, interpretable, open, and extensible simulation system for energy–economy–emissions transitions in Australia.

## 2. Motivation
Traditional optimisation-based models provide powerful insights but fail in areas where:
- decentralised decision-making matters,
- path-dependency and heterogeneity drive outcomes,
- behaviour is not globally optimal,
- transparency and reproducibility are paramount.

AgentZero addresses these gaps by emphasising interpretability and usability over mathematical purity.

## 3. Guiding Principles
1. **Everything is a Data Product**  
   All inputs, assumptions, scenarios, and outputs exist as versioned data objects with schemas and lineage.

2. **No Black Boxes**  
   Every transformation is paired with human-readable documentation explaining meaning, sources, and behaviour.

3. **Scenario = Executable Patch**  
   Scenarios are machine-actionable overlays on a baseline assumptions pack.

4. **Reproducibility by Construction**  
   Given the baseline + scenario + commit hash, results must exactly reproduce.

5. **Progressive Disclosure**  
   New users get narrative front-ends; expert users drill into raw agent rules.

6. **Guardrails Against Misuse**  
   Units, validity ranges, known pitfalls, and semantic tags accompany every field.

## 4. What AgentZero Is
- An agent‑based simulation engine with controllable foresight.
- An end‑to‑end pipeline producing interpretable, transparent results.
- A scenario experimentation environment.
- A storytelling platform for policy, industry, and research.

## 5. What AgentZero Is Not
- Not an optimisation model.
- Not a black-box ML model.
- Not a monolithic “all-knowing” framework.
- Not tied to any specific sectoral taxonomy.

## 6. Long-Term Vision
AgentZero becomes:
- the standard open modelling tool for Australian decarbonisation analysis,
- the first fully transparent agent-based pathways generator with explainable documentation,
- a shared platform for government, industry, and academia.
